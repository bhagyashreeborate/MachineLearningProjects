 This file contains Project for Face Detection Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms. # Dataset used for this project is MIT Center For Biological and Computational Learning (CBCL) lab.
 
  • Training set contains 2,429 faces, and 4,548 non-face images
  • Test set contaings 472 faces, and 23,573 non-face images
  • Each image file is 19 × 19 grayscale image, and is stored as a pgm file.

  That means –
  – Each image sample is 19 pixel wide and 19 pixel high.
  – So, each image sample is a 361 dimensional vector, where each ele- ment in the vector contains the grayscale value of a pixel from the image.
  – A grayscale value of a pixel takes any (discrete integer) value from the range {0,1,···,255}
  

Implemented the Face Detection using Naive Bayes Classifier, Batch gradient descent based logistic regression (BGD-LR), Stochastic  gradient  descent  based  logistic regression (SGD-LR).
